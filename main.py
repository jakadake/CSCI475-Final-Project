# look for transition regions in the waveform data of a sound
# periods of rapid change with an inconsistent slope sign transitioning
#   from several values in a row with the same slope can indicate a
#   change in the phoneme/segment

# vary the sound produced by the klaat grid randomly within some
#   limit values just below the JND for that formant to create a dynamic
#   and more natural sounding voice

# define the klaat grid with the overall duration of the sound as the length
#
